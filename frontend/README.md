![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

**ResumAI Pro** is a modern, responsive, and schema-compliant frontend application designed to collect professional resume data. It features a sleek interface with Dark/Light mode support, dynamic form fields, and strictly structured JSON output optimized for backend processing.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎨 UI/UX Design
- **Professional Aesthetic:** Built with a "Glassmorphism" inspired dark mode and a clean, high-contrast light mode.
- **Theme Toggle:** Persistent Dark/Light mode switch (saves preference to LocalStorage).
- **Responsive Layout:** Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Micro-interactions:** Smooth animations for adding/removing rows and transitioning between modes.

### 🛠 Functional Capabilities
- **Two Entry Modes:**
  - **Detailed Builder:** Structured form with validation.
  - **Quick Sync:** Raw text paste or file upload for parsing.
- **Dynamic Sections:** Add or remove unlimited rows for *Experience*, *Education*, *Projects*, *Skills*, and *Certificates*.
- **Smart Input:** Typing a comma (`,`) in specific fields (e.g., Company Name) automatically adds a new entry row.
- **Passport Photo Module:** Instant image preview for profile headshots.
- **Schema Validation:** The final output is a structured JSON object strictly matching the backend `schema.py`.
